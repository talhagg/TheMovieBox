# ðŸŽ¬ MovieBox

**Purpose of the App:**

An application made in MVVM architecture, where users can see the details of the movies and make their own favorite lists. Technologies I use: Alamofire, SDWebImage, CoreData

Protocol Oriented Programming and the application I made by following Solid Principles added a lot to me in the name of clean coding.
